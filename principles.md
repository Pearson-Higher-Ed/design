**Disclaimer:** We are working on updating the principles, which won't be ready until sometime in 2018. Please [contact the UX Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/contact) for the latest progress.


Follow these principles when designing for Pearson applications:




## Approachable

Our designs should be pleasant, friendly, and welcoming, and of course, accessible across all devices and technologies.

Example: [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)




## Empowering

Our experience should facilitate the growth of our users, allowing them to achieve their goals. That success is then associated with our product experience.

Example: [Fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/home)




## Memorable

Itâ€™s critical that our product designs carry aspects of our brand in a way that is unique and memorable to our users.

Example: [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/home/), [Pandora](https://www.pandora.com/)




## Enthusiastic

Our product should be energetic, fun, and most importantly be inspiring; Championing our users to meet their goals.

Example: [Google](https://www.google.com/)



## Simple

Our product should be extremely simple and intuitive for our users. Our interface should get out of the way.

Example: [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)
