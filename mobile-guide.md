      We think about mobile components in levels of complexity:
      - Element: a button color, a button type style
      - Atom: made of multiple elements, ie: a button
      - Molecule: made up of multiple atoms, such as a login screen composing of an input field, password field and log-in button.
      - Compound: made up of multiple molocules, which defines a workflow, ie: user log-in, including error and feedback states.

      OS design standards will dictate most of how elements and atoms are designed within our mobile products.
      Molocules and compounds will tend to remain consistent across each OS.
