usage_guidelines: |
  All pages should follow the guidance of this component for laying out their contents.

blocks:
  - type: section
    name: Grid Structure

  - type: two column
    text: |
      The grid consists of several key parts that include the Container, Container Margins, Columns, and Gutters.

      All columns reside within the *Container*, which is located at the root level of a page. Depending on the breakpoint, the container will have *Container Margins* of various sizes. The container also has a maximum width property, beyond which only the container margins grow in size.

      The container is divided into 12 proportional *Columns* which contain actual content. These are separated by *Gutters* of a fixed size (which varies based on the breakpoint again).

      See the redlines for the exact dimensions of each feature at each breakpoint.
