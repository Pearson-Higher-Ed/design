usage_guidelines: |
  Every instance of a button should come from this component. See the sections below for information about when to each each type of button.

blocks:
  - type: section
    name: Button types

  - type: two column
    text: |
      Buttons come in several different types. Each defines a normal, active/hover, and disabled state.

      **Primary** indicates the main call to action and should only appear once per group of buttons.

      **Default** is your basic button, it can appear multiple times in a given group.

    contents:

        caption: Both button types in their various states.

  - type: section
    name: Button sizes

  - type: two column
    text: |
      Buttons come in default and large sizes. Prefer the default size but feel free to use the large size where they would fit better with surrounding content. Both button sizes are meant to pair with equally sized inputs.
    contents:
      - type: narrow image
        src: ./assets/sizes.png
        caption: The two button sizes.

  - type: section
    name: Confirmation Buttons

  - type: two column
    text: |
      In situations where the user should receive feedback that the action initiated by a button was successful use the Confirmation Button style which integrates feedback.

      For simple binary confirmation feedback, this type of button is sufficientâ€”an additional alert or message is unnecessary.

      ### Button Reset
      If the action may be repeated, then the button can reset to it's original state after presenting the success message. If it's a one-off action then it should remain in the message state.

      ### Page Navigation
      Should the user be navigated to another page after success?
    contents:
      - type: narrow video
        src: ./assets/confirmation.short.mov
        caption: The loading indicator should appear for at least 500ms to provide the proper context.
      - type: narrow video
        src: ./assets/confirmation.long.mov
        caption: If the action takes longer than 500ms then the loader is displayed until the action completes.

  - type: two column
    text: |
      ### Error style
      If the action failed to complete, there is an error state for the button which should be paired with an explanatory alert.
    contents:
      - type: narrow video
        src: ./assets/error.short.mov
        caption: If the action results in an error that can be presented within the button context as well. Make sure to pair this with an explanatory alert.
