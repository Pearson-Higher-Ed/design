# Overview information for the component
tagline: |
  Graphical control element used to visualize the progression of an operation such as course copy, course setup, or assignment creation.
description:
features:
  - Complete vs Incomplete Status
  - Compliance with Accessiblity
usage_guidelines: |
  Whenever you need to indicate the progress of a system process such as uploading a file, copying a course, etc. use the Progress Bar to provide feedback to the user. This component should generally not be used to present a static "progress", prefer instead a single bar chart or similar design.

# Main contents of the component definition
# `blocks` is a list of the content chunks to display. Several different types
# are currently supported, including:
#
#    * section (added to TOC, main header)
#    * two column (column of text with images, tables, or code on the right)
#    * palette (creates tables for foreground, background, and accent colors)
blocks:

  # The section type is added to the TOC and is used to delineate major chunks
  # of the article
  - type: section
    name: Basic Progress Bar

  - type: two column
    text: |
      The determinate progress bar shows the user how far along a process with a known start and end point has progressed. For processes with an unknown end point, use the [Loading Indicator](/design/c/loading-indicator) instead.

      As the process proceeds, the bar fills up and the label text is updated. The formatting of the label should be contextual. For example, if you are measuring time, the label might read "5 Minutes Remaining."

    # (optional) A list of items to put in the right column
    contents:
      # Images can be wide or narrow, wide images are 760px and narrow are 370px

      ### Alternative text alignment
      The progress bar label is centered by default, but can be either left or right aligned if needed.
    contents:
      - type: narrow image
        src: ./assets/left.aligned.png

  - type: two column

      ### Loading animation
      For situations where the process is likely to stall at one or more points for more than a second or two, an animation can be used to indicate that the system is still functioning.
