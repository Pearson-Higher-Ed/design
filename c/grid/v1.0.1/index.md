tagline: |
   The grid system defines the page layout for aligning elements at different viewport sizes.

features:
  - Adapts to standard breakpoints
  - Consistent fluid behavior
  - Handy 12 column grid that can support many layouts
  - Integration with Templates component for easy usage
usage_guidelines: |
  You should generally **not** use this component directly, prefer instead to use [Templates](/design/c/templates/beta) and [Presentation Strategies](/design/c/presentation-strategies/beta) in your designs.

blocks:
  - type: section
    name: Grid Structure
    exports:
      - Grid

  - type: two column
    text: |
      The grid consists of four key parts: the Container, Container Margins, Columns, and Gutters.

      All columns reside within the *Container*, which is located at the root level of a page. Depending on the breakpoint, the container will have *Container Margins* of various sizes. The container also has a maximum width property, beyond which only the container margins grow in size.

      The container is divided into 12 proportional *Columns* which contain actual content. These are separated by *Gutters* of a fixed size (which varies based on the breakpoint again).

      See the redlines for the exact dimensions of each feature at each breakpoint.
