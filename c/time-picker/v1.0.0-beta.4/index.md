blocks:
  - type: section
    name: Single Time Input

  - type: two column
    text: |

      This type of time picker is used for picking a single time (ex. assignment due time).

  - type: two column
    text: |
      ### Default State
      The single time picker consists of a specialized input field (including a time icon) and a dropdown component.

      By default the dropdown is hidden until the user interacts with the time input field.

      In the field label, provide formatting example (hh:mm am/pm).

  - type: two column
    text: |
      ### Focus State (w/o selected time)

      **Upon focus:**

      - A cursor appears within the field
      - The dropdown appears.  Note, the size of the input isnâ€™t tied to the width of the dropdown.
      - No time is selected by default

      **The dropdown closes when:**

      - The user makes a selection from the dropdown
      - The user begins to manually type in the field
      - Focus is lost from field or dropdown

      If the user closes the dropdown without making a selection, it reverts back to Default State.

  - type: two column
    text: |
      ### Focus State (w/selected time)

      **Upon focus:**

      - The dropdown appears and shows the selected time
      - The text in the field is highlighted

      **The dropdown closes when:**

      - The user makes a selection from the dropdown
      - The user begins to manually type in the field
      - Focus is lost from field or dropdown

      Note that for the first and second points, focus remains on the field until the user clicks elsewhere.

  - type: two column
    text: |
      ### Selected Date (no focus)

      - If the user has made a selection and removed focus from the dropdown or field, then the time field shows the numeric time and period.
      - If a field with a previously selected time regains focus, the field and dropdown switch to Focus State (w/ selected time).

  - type: section
    name: Range Input

  - type: two column
    text: |
      This type of time picker is to be used for choosing a range with specific start and end times (ex. course beginning and end).

      ### Default State
      The default state of the first time input (start) initially behaves the same way as a single time input field.

    text: |
      ### Start Time Focus w/o Selection
      When the user interacts with the start time input field, it gains focus and the dropdown appears.

      - type: wide image

  - type: two column
    text: |
      ### End Time Focus w/o Selection

      Note that once the user has made a start time selection, focus should automatically switch to the end time and the dropdown for the end time should open. Time selected in the start time and prior will not be in the dropdown.

      The time list can be customized to show shorter or longer increments (ex. 50 minutes class sessions).

      ### End Time Focus and Highlight w/ Selection

    contents:

  - type: two column

      ### Reopening the Start Time After Selecting Both Start and End Times

      If the user refocuses on the start time after having selected both a start and end time&#58;

        - The time picker appears with the start time selected
        - The time text in the field is highlighted
        - No disabled times are shown

      Making a selection will cause focus to automatically shift once again to the end time picker and field.

      If the user chooses a new start time *before* the previously chosen end time, the end time selection *will be retained* and the user will be automatically moved to the end time input field to confirm their selection.

      If the user chooses a new start time *after* the previously chosen end time, the end time selection *will clear* and the user will be automatically moved moved to the end time input field to make a new end time selection.
