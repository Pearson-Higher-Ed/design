features:
  - Answer user questions without leaving the product experience
  - Present articles based on the user's current location
  - In-page triggers can jump directly to relevant article

blocks:
  - type: section
    name: Help List

  - type: two column
    text: |
      This displays a listing of help articles relevant to the current url. Every url in the next gen platform should offer a Help List through this component. Common functionality includes:

      * Universal access through the [Header](/design/c/application-header/v1.1.0-beta.3/#rd-signed-out-mode)
      * Standard location of 'Contact Support' information
      * Articles relevant to the user's current location and role

      Selecting an article opens it within a [detail view](/design/c/drawer/v1.0.0-beta.7/#rd-detail-view) in the drawer.
    contents:
      - type: narrow image
        src: ./assets/help-list.png
        caption: Initially the drawer presents a list of help articles for the page.
      - type: narrow image
        src: ./assets/article-detail.png
        caption: Selecting an article navigates into it, presenting the full content.



  - type: section
    name: Standalone Articles

  - type: two column
    text: |
      In situations where a feature or tool only appears on a url under certain conditions any related help content should be documented with a Standalone Article. This presents just the relevant article, without access to the overall Help List.

      * Standalone Articles must be accessed exclusively through Embedded Activation, described below.
      * Standalone Articles must not appear in the Help List.
    contents:
      - type: narrow image
        src: ./assets/standalone-article.png
        caption: Example standalone article. Note there is not an option to go back to the overall Help List from here.

  - type: section
    name: Embedded Activation

  - type: two column
    text: |
      Selecting the "Help" link in the [App Header](/design/c/application-header/v1.1.0-beta.3/#rd-signed-out-mode) will open the Help List. You can also navigate directly to an article (either a standalone article or one from the list) through embedded activation.

      A Help icon or a "Learn More" link can be used to activate an article from within the page. These should be positioned near the relevant portion of the page.
    contents:
      - type: wide image
        src: ./assets/embedded-activation.png
        caption: Two examples of controls that can be embedded in the page. Normally you wouldn't mix and match the two styles like this.

      ### Accordions
      Content may be grouped into accordions which help organize and condense information.

      ### Info Boxes
      Authors may call extra attention to important information by wrapping it in an info box. There are three types available: 'Tip', 'Note', and 'Important'.

      Use these guidelines when authoring articles for the Contextual Help component.  If youâ€™re using MadCap Flare to author articles, see these [specifics for preparing Flare files][flare].

      [flare]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHNR5nudYBv_GGhSDoYHIvdxcEClsmSex0TcOw5G6kM/edit?ts=5739f2e3

      - type: text
        content: |

          ### Do
          * Write articles at the 9th grade reading level. If you like, use the Spelling and Grammar feature in MS Word. Click Spelling and Grammar and under Options, select "Show readability statistics".
          * Title articles in the form of a question. This is consistent with how issues are recorded in Salesforce Knowledge. Contact Us and Popular Resources are an exception to this guideline.
          * List the 'Contact Us' article at the bottom of the Help List. The Contact Us article is single sourced across all products adopting the contextual help component. Authors can find the Contact Us file in the SVN o-help directory: `o-help-content/EN-US/ContactSupport.html`
          * List Popular Student Resources and Popular Instructor Resources articles in the second to last position of the Help List.
          * Use Online Help Google Analytics and tech support data to determine what info to include in articles. Work with [Mark Giardina](mailto:mark.giardina@pearson.com) and [Matt Norris](mailto:matt.norris@pearson) to request KB metrics and usage reports. Be sure to also take advantage of the [Snapshot Tool](https://hepq.pearson.com/login).
          * Include accordions when necessary to improve readability of longer topics or procedures.
          * Link to external assets such as EI guides, Marketing PDFs, Videos, etc. from within the Popular Resources articles when relevant.
          * Add Help List articles that are role specific (educator/learner/TA).
          * List up to 5 custom articles at the top of the list. Custom articles are specifically relevant to features/tools accessible at the current URL. If the feature/tool is only available under certain conditions  it must be documented in a Standalone Article instead.
          * Follow the formatting guidelines.

          ### Don't
          * Reformat the layout or structure of Popular Resources and Contact Us article types. Your [UA Design representative](mailto:ann.persson@pearson.com) on the UXF Team will work with you in reviewing recommendations to ensure standardized contextual help articles are uniform across the customer experience.
          * Link to other articles in the contextual help component.
          * Include tables.
          * Exceed more than 7 articles per page (5 custom, 2 default: Contact Support and Popular Resources).
          * Include articles about features/tools which aren't permanently accessible from the current URL in the Help List. (Use standalone articles instead.)
          * Link out to Pearson Support KB articles.
          * Link out to Online Help Systems.

          ### Formatting guidelines

          #### Titles
          Every article should have a single title at the top, encoded as an `<h4>` tag after sanitization.

          #### Headings
          Articles headings should be structured and encoded as `<h5>` and `<h6>` tags after sanitization.

          #### Bold and italics
          Should be used normally to provide emphasis. The name of interactive elements (i.e. button labels) must be bolded.

          #### Unordered lists
          Should be used to organize content. Must not be nested more than two levels.

          #### Ordered lists
          Should be used to describe steps in a workflow. Should not exceed 9 items in length.

          #### Tips and notes
          Should be used to give handy bits of information more emphasis.

          #### Accordions
          Should be used for topics containing sub-topics or step procedures exceeding 9 steps.
