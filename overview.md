## Designing with the UI Kit

![](/UIKit/assets/UI Kit.png)

To start designing, download the UI Kit, a sketch file with ready-made components to help you speed up the work. Keep in mind that the UX Framework website component library is the ultimate source for guidance on design usage. In case of the discrepancies, always refer to the website for the latest design. We encourage you to notify us of the discrepancy, so we can fix them.




## Understanding versions

The versions you see on this website refer to the design of the component, which has no association with the UI Kit versions or the development versions. They are not related as they are maintained separately.


### What does the versioning numbers mean?

![](/img/semantic versioning@2.png)

We follow semantic versioning for managing our updates. Incrementation on each number implies different level of updates:

* __Major -__ Making incompatible design change  
   It’s likely that this change would affect how the component is placed in your mockup. In this case, you would need to adjust other UI elements on the page to accommodate this change.  
   _Example: Changing the height of the large button from 36px to 50px_
* __Minor -__ Adding functionality that are backwards-compatible  
   _Example: Adding the default button style to the library_
* __Patch -__ Making bug fixes that are backwards-compatible  
   _Example: Fixing a typo in the usage guidelines for buttons_



## Working with engineering
Each component includes a pre-built package of code for developers to incorporate the design into the final product. You don’t have to redline your use of a component. Simply note which component it is. For example, you can just point out that a button is a **large default button**, rather than creating the redlines for it.

Let the developers know what component you are referring to by sharing the link to that specific feature.

We know that what we provide are not perfect, so you might encounter some questions during the design or implementation process. We encourage you to contact us for questions or comments.

We are always happy to hear from you.
