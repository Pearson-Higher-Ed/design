## Designing with the UI Kit

![](/UIKit/assets/UI Kit.png)

Start designing [using the UI Kit]({{site.baseurl}}/UIKit), a sketch file with ready-made components to help you speed up the work. Keep in mind that the UX Framework website is the ultimate source for the latest designs and usage guidelines. In the case of discrepancies, always refer to the website. We ask that you [let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/contact), so we can fix them. Thanks!



## Understanding versions

The component versions on this website refer to the design itself, which has no association with the UI Kit versions or the development versions. This is because that they are created and maintained separately.

### What does the versioning numbers mean?

![](/img/semantic versioning@2.png)

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for managing our updates. Incrementation on each number implies different level of updates:

* __Major -__ Making incompatible design change  
   It’s likely that this change would affect how the component is placed in your mockup. In this case, you would need to adjust other UI elements on the page to accommodate this change.  
   _Example: Changing the height of the large button from 36px to 50px_
* __Minor -__ Adding functionality that are backwards-compatible  
   _Example: Adding the default button style to the library_
* __Patch -__ Making bug fixes that are backwards-compatible  
   _Example: Fixing a typo in the usage guidelines for buttons_



## Working with engineering

Each component includes a pre-built package of code for developers to incorporate the design into the final product. You don’t have to redline your use of a component. Simply note which component it is. For example, you can just point out that a button is a **large default button**, rather than creating the redlines for it.

Let the developers know what component you are referring to by directing them to the specifications on the UX Framework website. You can do this by sharing  the unique link to a feature by clicking "copy link" as shown bellow:
