      Pearson customers are the best people in the world.  We design content experiences for them with the goal to:

      - **Empower**. Help people understand Pearson by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our products.
      - **Respect**. Treat people with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don’t market at people; communicate with them. Less features, more benefits.
      - **Guide**. Think of yourself as a tour guide for our readers. Whether you’re leading them through our marketing website, apps, or educational materials, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.
      - **Be Honest**. Understand Pearson’s place in people’s lives and be transparent about known issues. Tell them what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the information they need, along with opportunities to learn more.

      Imagine you’re at a party and you run into Pearson. What’s your impression? Are we friendly? Engaging? Someone you’d like to hang out with again?  Every exchange between the product and the user is a social interaction that results in emotional reactions, experiences, and relationships. Our personality is reflected in how we carry the conversation with our users throughout the learning journey. How we carry the conversation should be:

      - **Insightful**: Our voice is pleasant, friendly and welcoming with copy that is crafted to have an intuitive emotional sensitivity to the needs of the user.
      - **Optimistic**: Our voice is enthusiastic and inspiring with copy that is crafted to connect the feeling of achievement with our brand.
      - **Considered**: We speak thoughtfully thinking of the users’ feelings first to reflect a global voice with memorable experiences.
      - **Conversational**: Our UI copy makes the complex easy using simple, clear language to evoke feelings of intimacy and connection to our product.

      How does Pearson sound in a conversation? Loud and boastful? Respectful and witty? Personable and inviting? Our tone  is a subset of our personality. Use the emotional state and mental model of the user as your guiding compass and adjust your tone accordingly.
