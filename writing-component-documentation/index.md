Component design documentation is currently generated and hosted through Github Pages. In order to write documentation for a new component or update existing documentation you'll need to install some command line utilities and become familiar with the basics of contributing to a git repository. Here are a couple of screencasts that will get you up and running even without previous experience.

## Getting Started
This video will walk you through the process of installing all the software necessary to create your own component documentation page. Note that you will need sudo access to complete these steps. You can test for sudo access by opening the terminal application and running this command:

```
sudo -v
```

If you get an error message saying that you are not in the sudoers file then you will need to contact your IT group to gain access.
