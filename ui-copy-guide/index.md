      *Disclaimer: This is a working document and your personal go-to for design inspiration and tips on designing UI copy.*

      Pearson customers are the best people in the world.  We design content experiences for them with the goal to be:

      - **Empowering**. Help people understand Pearson by using language that informs, empowers, and encourages them to make the most of our products.
      - **Memorable**. Customers remember how we make them feel. Treat people with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don't patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don't market at people, communicate with them.
      - **Enthusiastic**. Think of yourself as a champion and tour guide for our readers. Whether you’re leading them through our marketing website, apps, or educational materials, communicate in a positive, optimistic, and helpful way. After all, there will be ebbs and flows in their journey, let's keep people motivated.
      - **Approachable**. Understand Pearson’s place in people’s lives and be transparent about known issues. Tell them what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the information they need, along with opportunities to learn more.

      To achieve those goals, we design UI copy to be:

      - **Clear**. Understand the topic you're writing about. Use simple words and sentences.
      - **Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself what purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
      - **Empathetic**. Write like a human. Don't be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from sign in copy to system notifications, should be warm and human.
      - **Appropriate**. Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you're writing to and what you're writing about.

      To ensure our UI copy follows our guiding principles and goals, we:
      -**Embrace "you"**. The word "you" automatically catches your attention and establishes a relationship between you and your reader. Be personable. It brings your reader into the conversation.
      -**Read it Outloud**. Often, what looks right on the page will sound awkward and robotic outloud. Read outloud to hear the conversational style of your UI copy. If it doesn't sound right read outloud, it's not conversational.
      -**Value benefits over features**. What's in it for the user? Design customer-focused UI copy focused on how learning features will make the user's life easier.
      -**Keep it light**. Befriend brevity! Write clearly with just the right amount appropriate for the conversation.

    content: Our Product Voice

  - type: content
    content: |
      Imagine you’re at a party and you run into Pearson. What’s your impression? Are we friendly? Engaging? Someone you’d like to hang out with again?  Every exchange between the product and the user is a social interaction that results in emotional reactions, experiences, and relationships. Our personality is reflected in how we carry the conversation with our users throughout the learning journey. How we carry the conversation should be:

      - **Insightful**: Our voice is pleasant, friendly and welcoming with copy that is crafted to have an intuitive emotional sensitivity to the needs of the user.
      - **Optimistic**: Our voice is enthusiastic and inspiring with copy that is crafted to connect the feeling of achievement with our brand.
      - **Considered**: We speak thoughtfully and respectfully thinking of the users’ feelings first to reflect a global voice with memorable experiences.
      - **Conversational**: Our UI copy makes the complex easy using simple, clear language to evoke feelings of intimacy and connection to our product.

    content: Our Product Tone

  - type: content
    content: |
      How does Pearson sound in a conversation? Loud and boastful? Personable and inviting? Laid back and witty? Our tone  is a subset of our personality and should be adjusted for the situation. Use the emotional state and mental model of the user as your guiding compass and adjust your tone accordingly. For example, UI copy for assessments would be sensitive to user anxiety about taking an exam online. To be empathetic of that, your copy would be calm, clear, and pleasant oppose to witty or formal, which may create more anxiety.
