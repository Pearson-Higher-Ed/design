title: Tabs - Prototype
state: inprogress
---

In addition to being used as a primary content divider or navigation method, tabs can also be used within a container. All redline values remain the same, but should be used with respect to the bounding container. Tabs containers may utilize a background color (Dirty Ice #F8F8F8) to differentiate them from the container body.
