Tabs are a way of dividing related content into focused views. They can be used as high level navigation, or to quickly switch between something like groups of content or aspects of a single textbook. Tabs may be used on an entire page, or within a closed container. In most cases, they should be located above the content or views theyâ€™re dividing.

Default State indicates the typical appearance of an available, but not selected tab

Active State indicates the currently selected tab, whose associated content is currently being displayed

Hover State indicates the appearance of a tab currently in focus

Disabled State indicates the appearance of a tab that cannot be selected or displayed
