title: Slider - Prototype

The slider can be dragged left or right to select either a specific quantitative value or to indicate a qualitative location on a spectrum.

When used to input a quantitative value, the slider should always present the exact value selected, either within an input or as a static label. This is not required for qualitative inputs.

Just like with other inputs, labels should generally be used to indicate the purpose of each slider.
