UX Framework is Pearson’s design system. We provide guidelines, tools, and resources to help designers and developers create better user experience more efficiently.

## UX Framework components
Our components are designed to be...

- **Universal**  
   Each component reflects the needs of Pearson as a whole, and is designed with the greater global community in mind.


- **Consistent**  
   Each component is defined by a set of shared principles and patterns to provide a cohesive user experience.


- **Usable**  
   Each component is intuitive and easy to use for performing tasks effectively.

- **Accessible**  
   Each component complies with the Pearson Accessibility Guidelines to ensure it is accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.

- **Responsive**  
   Each component is flexible and adapts to different devices to optimize the experience.


## Benefits


- **Bridging the gap between design and engineering**  
   By sharing the same vocabulary for features and configurations, designers and developers can communicate more effectively.


- **Bringing a more coherent user experience**  
   There are usually multiple designers working on a project, and each of them may come up with unique solutions that can lead to disjointed  user experience. Building with a consistent UI pattern makes it easier for the users to understand the product.

- **Enabling us to focus on solving greater problems**  
   Imagine designers and developers spending time designing every little nut and bolt for a product. We can utilize this collective effort by providing well designed components and patterns so you don’t have to reinvent the wheels. With more time freed up from nudging the pixels, designers have more time for creativity and innovation.

- **Allowing us to be truly agile**  
   Consuming the code package allows updates at a global scale, which helps the product evolve faster.


## Process

Our designs evolve over time as we improve the usability and quality of the components. Here is our process for updating the components:


1. A consumer emails the UXF Design Team (uxf-design@pearson.com) with a brief description of the needs.
2. The UX Framework Design Team collaborates with that consumer to design the new functionality or modify the existing component and create documentation for reuse.
3. The design goes through the governance review to ensure it meets the requirements from the [Component Quality Checklist!]({{site.baseurl}}/membership-spec).
4. The UX Framework Development Team or the consumer builds the functionality and create documentation for reuse.
