UX Framework is Pearson’s design system. We provide guidelines, tools, and resources to help designers and developers create better user experience more efficiently.

##UX Framework Components
Our components are designed to be...

- **Universal**

   Each component reflect the needs of Pearson as a whole and is designed with the greater global community in mind.


- **Consistent**

   The components are defined by shared principles and patterns to ensure the cohesiveness in the user experience.


- **Usable**

   Each component is intuitive and easy to use for performing tasks effectively.

- **Accessible**

   Each component complies with the Pearson Accessibility Guidelines to ensure it is accessible to a larger audience, including people with disabilities.

- **Responsive**

   Each component is flexible and adapts as device size changes to optimize the experience.


## The benefits


- **Bridging the gap between design and engineering**

   By sharing the same vocabulary for features and configurations, designers and developers can communicate more effectively and clearly.


- **Bringing a more coherent user experience**

   There are usually multiple designers working on a project, and each of them may come up with unique solutions that can lead to disjointed  user experience. Building with a consistent UI pattern makes it easier for the users to understand the product. It also makes product integration smother from the production perspective.

- **Enabling us to focus on solving greater problems**

   Imagine designers and developers spending time designing every little nut and bolt for a product. We are sharing this collective effort to provide a quality component set so you don’t have to reinvent the wheels. With more time freed up from nudging the pixels, designers have more time for creativity and innovation that brings greater impact to our users.

- **Allowing us to be truly agile**

   Consuming the code package make updates much more efficient at a global scale. Rapid iteration allows the product to evolve and improve faster.


##Our process

The UX Framework library will adapt to the needs of Pearson’s products as they evolve over time.

Here is the process for making updates to components:


1. A consumer emails the UXF Design Team (uxf-design@pearson.com) with a brief description of the needs.
2. The UX Framework Team collaborates with that consumer to design the new functionality or modify the existing component and create documentation for reuse.
3. The design goes through the governance review to ensure it meets the requirements from the Component Quality Checklist.
4. The UX Framework Development Team or the consumer builds the functionality and create documentation for reuse.
