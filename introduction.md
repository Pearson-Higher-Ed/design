UX Framework is Pearson’s design system. We provide guidelines, tools, and resources to help designers and developers build a cohesive user experience across the products, more efficiently.

## Components
The UX Framework components are a collection of standardized UI elements and patterns for building products. See the [designer’s guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/overview) for more information on how to use the components.

Our components are designed to be:


- **Universal**  
  Reflect the needs of Pearson as a whole, keeping in mind, the greater global community.


- **Consistent**  
   Follow a consistent visual style and are defined by a set of shared principles.


- **Usable**  
   Intuitive and easy to use for performing tasks effectively.

- **Accessible**  
   Comply with the Pearson Accessibility Guidelines to ensure the user interface is  accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities.

- **Responsive**  
   Flexible and adaptive to optimize the user experience on different devices.


## Benefits


- **Helps designers and developers communicate more effectively**  
   By using a shared language for the features and configurations, we are able to bridge the gap between design and development.


- **Creates a more coherent user experience**  
   Having multiple designers working together on a project could easily lead to a disjointed user experience. Following a unified design system keeps the design consistent throughout the user journey.

- **Enables teams to focus on solving greater problems**  
   Designers will have more room for creativity and innovation with more time freed up from nudging pixels. Developers will be able to work more efficiently using the code package that enables updates at a global scale. With greater efficiency, teams can truly be agile.


## Process

Here are the steps for adding new components or modifying existing components as our library grows:

1. **Request**   
A consumer emails the [UXF Design Team](mailto:uxf-design@pearson.com) with a brief description of the needs.

2. **Design**  
The UX Framework Design Team collaborates with that consumer to design the new functionality or modify existing components. Then, we document the design and usage guidelines on the site.

3. **Review**  
The design goes through the governance review to ensure it meets a set of requirements from the [Component Quality Checklist]({{site.baseurl}}/membership-spec)to ensure the quality.

4. **Develop**  
The UX Framework Development Team collaborates with the consumer to build the functionality or modify existing components. Then, we release the code repository for people to reuse.
