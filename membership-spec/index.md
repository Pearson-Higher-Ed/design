title: Library Membership Specification
section: contribute
version: 1.0.0-beta.1
intro: |
  Every component listed in the Component Library must satisfy all the requirements contained in this document. To learn about submitting components for inclusion see the [Component Creation Guide][creation-guide].

  Requirements are divided into two sections, Design and Development. Your component definition will be approved based on the design requirements and the implementation is approved based on the development requirements.

  - name: Universal
    description: |
      Elemental Design and the Component Library are tools meant to serve the entirety of Pearson's next gen educational ecosystem.
    reqs:
      - req: |
          U1: Components must reflect the needs of Pearson as a whole rather than just the needs of one product.
        type: mandatory

            content: |
              This requirement means you should consider what other products might also use a component and how that could change your design. It's a best practice to engage other teams mock up the component in several different product contexts.

              You should also consider the various audiences for a component (student, instructor). Where possible, a component should be designed to work for the broadest group of users, rather than specifically for one audience.

  - name: Consistent
    description: |
      One of the main goals of Elemental Design, components should enable a variety of teams to work on different aspects of the Pearson ecosystem while still producing a consistent, coherent, and accessible experience.
    reqs:
      - req: |
          C1: A component should not duplicate functionality found in an existing component, either in whole or in part.

              New component should instead leverage existing work by declaring dependencies on useful components which are already in the library.

      - req: |
          C3: A component should reflect the current overall design aesthetic in use across the next gen products (e.g. Console, ILP, Pi, Exchange).

          C5: Components should keep configuration options to the minimum possible.

            content: |
              This generally means you should not allow consumers of your component to customize the appearance, style, or behavior or the component. Only add options when different modes or configurable features are needed to meet the core purpose of the component.

              For example, the header component has a few different modes which are needed to meet the use cases of a signed out user vs. a signed in user. This is appropriate configuration. On the other hand, options to change the color, font, or corner styles of a component are extraneous and will perpetuate a fractured and disjointed experience.

      Not only should our designs present a consistent and pleasing interface, but an intuitive and understandable one as well.
    reqs:
      - req: |
          UE1: A component should be evaluated for usefulness, usability, and accessibility through feedback from users with the widest possible range of abilities.

            content: |
              The necessary depth of user research increases with the scale, complexity, and novelty of a component. Atomic components such as simple buttons may only require internal documentation (including a UXD Accessibility Checklist). More complex components should be evaluated internally and externally through user feedback. Contact a User Experience Researcher if you have questions about the appropriateness of research for your component design.

              A non-exhaustive list of resource includes: Open Labs, Learning Design Research, Student and Educator Advisory Boards, and dedicated UX Research. Also, don't forget about the extensive collection of previous reports and findings.
