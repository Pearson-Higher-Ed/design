section: contribute
version: 1.1.0
intro: |
  Every component listed in the Component Library must satisfy all the requirements contained in this document. To learn about submitting components for inclusion see the [Component Creation Guide][creation-guide].

  Requirements are divided into two sections, Design and Development. Your component definition will be approved based on the design requirements and the implementation is approved based on the development requirements.

              This requirement means you should consider what other products might also use a component and how that could change your design. It's a best practice to engage other teams mock up the component in several different product contexts.

              You should also consider the various audiences for a component (student, instructor). Where possible, a component should be designed to work for the broadest group of users, rather than specifically for one audience.

          - name: Explanation
            content: |
              This generally means you should not allow consumers of your component to customize the appearance, style, or behavior or the component. Only add options when different modes or configurable features are needed to meet the core purpose of the component.

              For example, the header component has a few different modes which are needed to meet the use cases of a signed out user vs. a signed in user. This is appropriate configuration. On the other hand, options to change the color, font, or corner styles of a component are extraneous and will perpetuate a fractured and disjointed experience.

              The necessary depth of user research increases with the scale, complexity, and novelty of a component. Atomic components such as simple buttons may only require internal documentation (including a UXD Accessibility Checklist). More complex components should be evaluated internally and externally through user feedback. Contact a User Experience Researcher if you have questions about the appropriateness of research for your component design.

              A non-exhaustive list of resource includes: Open Labs, Learning Design Research, Student and Educator Advisory Boards, and dedicated UX Research. Also, don't forget about the extensive collection of previous reports and findings.

Designers must provide a [UXD Accessibility Checklist](https://docs.google.com/a/pearson.com/document/d/1Hqa-p_CePJ4x7O7ALOCWM88OaeODx9dP6gEko00sdxs/edit?usp=sharing) with each component that ensures that PAG has been considered during the design phase.

              The Pearson Accessibility Guidelines are a company-wide implementation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. WCAG 2.0 is a global product of the Worldwide Web Consortium that mandates specific accessibility minima and features for compliance at Levels A, AA, and AAA. The Pearson Accessibility Guidelines ensure Level AA compliance by providing a design and development framework of 42 guidelines specific to learner needs and Pearson products.

              The UXD Accessibility Checklist specifies a subset of the 42 Pearson Accessibility Guidelines which **must** be addressed during the design phase. Not every item on the UXD Accessibility Checklist will apply to every design. However, each should be carefully considered and documented for clarity and to ensure the accessibility needs of the component are understood downstream.

              All teams are expected to re-use available elements and compounds in the npm registry. When developing a new component it is required to check the npm registry to ensure if a similar component already exists. If one exists it is necessary to reach out to the team and discuss potential updates to the original component before trying to create your own.

              When creating a new component it is recommended to use existing sub components and element required to create a new component. The key idea behind this is to reuse components wherever applicable.

              Character encoding can cause problems, especially on sites that are predominantly in English with a few foreign characters here and there, where issues with character encoding can easily go unnoticed.

              Ensure that your pages are UTF-8 encoded, using both an HTTP response header **and** an HTML meta tag: `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`. Place this as the first tag within the `<head>` section of the page, before `<title>`, since itâ€™s important that the browser knows the right character set to use before it gets to any content.

              Itâ€™s often considered OK to serve forms on insecure pages as long as the form posts to a secure destination. This is not acceptable, because an attacker can modify the page that serves the form, to simply change the form post destination.
